I am a deaf software developer. I am currently a student at Friends University, where I am pursuing a bachelor's degree. I enjoy learning multiple programming languages and learning multiple platforms. I am specialized in multi-platform applications and accessibility issues. 

Most of my work is done privately on my student GitHub account and my staff account ðŸ¤”. As of now, I am investing my time in my personal projects where everyone can access them on this account.

ðŸŒ± To do ðŸ”­:
<ui>
 <li>
   Get more creative with my GitHub profile ðŸ‘¾
 </li>
 <li>
   Brainstorm things that I wasn't taught at my college ðŸ§ 
 </li>
 <li>
   Discord Bot for a small Minecraft server community ðŸ¤–
 </li>
</ul>
